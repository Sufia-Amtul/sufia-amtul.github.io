# Amtul Sufia - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Sufia! I have a strong background in technical support and computational science, with a focus on applying data-driven solutions to solve complex problems. Currently serving as an **Advisor II, Technical Support at Concentrix**, I provide expert assistance in troubleshooting software, hardware, and network issues, consistently achieving a **95% customer satisfaction rate**. My technical skills have helped improve system performance by **15%** and ensure a **98% adherence rate** to SLAs.

I hold a **Master’s Degree in Computational Science** and a **Master’s Degree in Computer Science**. My education has equipped me with advanced skills in data analysis, machine learning, and computational techniques, which I am eager to apply in data-centric roles. During my academic journey, I gained hands-on experience working with large datasets, building predictive models, and performing statistical analyses to uncover actionable insights.

In my free time, I enjoy expanding my technical expertise by exploring new data analysis tools, learning about the latest developments in machine learning, and experimenting with coding projects. I am passionate about using my analytical skills to drive innovation and deliver impactful results.

This is a repository to showcase my skills, share projects, and track my progress in software engineering, data science, and data analysis. I am excited to contribute my expertise and collaborate on solving complex challenges in these fields.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data science and data analytics projects, briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases. 

## [Project 1: Used-Car-Price-Prediction-System](https://github.com/Sufia-Amtul/Used-Car-Price-Prediction-System)

**Goal:** To determine which among the selected algorithms Linear Regression(LR), Random Forest(RF), XGBoost(XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) is efficient in predicting the price of used cars.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing dataset that contains 6,019 instances (cars) including 3,205 diesel cars, 2,746 petrol cars, 56 CNG cars, 10 LPG cars, and 2 electric cars in India.  The dataset included brand and model of the car, location, year, total kilometres driven, fuel type, transmission type, owner type, mileage, engine, New_Price, Price (target)and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions, the analysis revealed that Power, Engine and Year have the highest correlation with Price, while Kilometers_Driven shows no significant correlation with Price. Additionally, Mileage has a notable negative correlation with Price, indicating that cars with better mileage tend to be priced lower.
