# [Project 1: Used-Car-Price-Prediction-System](https://github.com/Sufia-Amtul/Used-Car-Price-Prediction-System)

This is a project I did for my masters research paper, where I build a prediction tool for a used car sales dataset. 
- Data was taken from the Kaggle source
- The motivation behind this research is to find the optimal algorithm among the Linear Regression(LR), Random Forest(RF), XGBoost(XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) for given dataset.
- The model uses Random Forest technique for predicting the car price
