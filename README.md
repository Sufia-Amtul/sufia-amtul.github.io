Hi, I'm Sufia! I have a strong background in technical support and computational science, with a focus on applying data-driven solutions to solve complex problems. Currently serving as an **Advisor II, Technical Support at Concentrix**, I provide expert assistance in troubleshooting software, hardware, and network issues, consistently achieving a **95% customer satisfaction rate**. My technical skills have helped improve system performance by **15%** and ensure a **98% adherence rate** to SLAs.

I hold a **Master’s Degree in Computational Science** and a **Master’s Degree in Computer Science**. My education has equipped me with advanced skills in data analysis, machine learning, and computational techniques, which I am eager to apply in data-centric roles. During my academic journey, I gained hands-on experience working with large datasets, building predictive models, and performing statistical analyses to uncover actionable insights.

In my free time, I enjoy expanding my technical expertise by exploring new data analysis tools, learning about the latest developments in machine learning, and experimenting with coding projects. I am passionate about using my analytical skills to drive innovation and deliver impactful results.

This is a repository to showcase my skills, share projects, and track my progress in software engineering, data science, and data analysis. I am excited to contribute my expertise and collaborate on solving complex challenges in these fields.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data science and data analytics projects, briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases. 

## [Project 1: Used-Car-Price-Prediction-System](https://github.com/Sufia-Amtul/Used-Car-Price-Prediction-System)

**Goal:** To determine which among the selected algorithms Linear Regression(LR), Random Forest(RF), XGBoost(XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) is efficient in predicting the price of used cars.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing dataset that contains 6,019 instances (cars) and its features such as brand and model of the car, location, year, total kilometres driven, fuel type, transmission type, owner type, mileage, engine, New_Price, Price (target)and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions, the analysis revealed that Power, Engine and Year have the highest correlation with Price, while Kilometers_Driven shows no significant correlation with Price. Additionally, Mileage has a notable negative correlation with Price, indicating that cars with better mileage tend to be priced lower.
  
## [Project 2: Car-Sales-Analysis](https://github.com/Sufia-Amtul/Car-Sales-Analysis)

**Goal:** To examine a comprehensive analysis of the 2017 car sales landscape, focusing on the performance of key brands in terms of market share and revenue, understanding customer preferences for fuel and transmission types, and highlighting historical sales trends over time.

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of car records. The records include the car features, owner type, price for older models versus new models and other relevant information. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization.

**Technology:** Microsoft Power BI

**Results:** The Car Sales Analysis Dashboard reveals that both luxury brands and mainstream brands performed well, indicating a balanced market catering to diverse customer preferences. Diesel and petrol are the dominant fuel types, while alternative fuels are underrepresented, suggesting a potential growth area for electric and hybrid vehicles. The strong preference for manual transmissions may reflect regional driving habits or cost preferences, though manufacturers should also consider the growing popularity of automatic vehicles. Additionally, the sharp decline in sales after 2015 highlights the potential impact of external factors, such as global economic shifts or changing consumer preferences, on the automotive market.
